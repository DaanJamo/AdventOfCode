# Advent of Code

Welcome to my AoC repo! This year I am finally committing to get as far as I can, so far it has been going well.

For 2024 I am using DenoðŸ¦• (to get those stickers) because I picked it up to see how it differed from node
and liked it too much to put it down. Never thought to get in the zone from Typescript of all things...

Some nice commands to get started with (use deno task to see available flags):

```Deno
// Initialize files for today
deno task init
// Watch the tests for the examples for today for some nice TDD
deno task dev
// Execute part 1 of todays puzzle
deno task solve
// Execute part 2, with verbose output if available
deno task solve -p=2 -v
```

These commands were partly inspired by [Maurits Wilke's deno template](https://github.com/MauritsWilke/AdventOfCode/tree/deno).
I had permission to use the template full-stop, but I have not felt the need to bother with using a fetch API yet.
